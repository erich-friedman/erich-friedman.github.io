<CENTER><H1>Problem of the Month<br>(February 2009)</H1></CENTER>

One type of word play is to find a common phrase that describes a letter of the alphabet.  For example, the phrase "first of all" describes the letter A, since A is the first letter of "all".  Here are English phrases for all 26 letters:<p>

<table align=center bgcolor=FFFFDD border=1 cellpadding=7>
<tr align=center><td>A = first of all<td>N = center of attention
<tr align=center><td>B = fifth of bourbon<td>O = second in command
<tr align=center><td>C = first in command<td>P = front of the pack
<tr align=center><td>D = end of the world<td>Q = front of the queue
<tr align=center><td>E = beginning of the end<td>R = center of inertia
<tr align=center><td>F = first in flight<td>S = start of something
<tr align=center><td>G = middle of the night<td>T = middle of the century
<tr align=center><td>H = middle of nowhere<td>U = fourth of January
<tr align=center><td>I = fifth of tequila<td>V = center of gravity
<tr align=center><td>J = first of January<td>W = end of the rainbow
<tr align=center><td>K = back of the pack<td>X = a wax finish
<tr align=center><td>L = first in line<td>Y = fourth of July<br><font color=red>(George Sicherman)
<tr align=center><td>M = first of many<td>Z = led zeppelin
</table><p>

Can you improve any of these?  What common English phrases can be used to describe the 26<sup>2</sup> different letter pairs?  If you are not a native English speaker, perhaps you would prefer to find phrases in your language for each single letter.
