Take a set of congruent polygons.  Form a graph using the polygons as vertices, and draw an edge between two polygons if they share part of an edge.  For example, the collection of squares below on the left has the adjacency graph below on the right.<p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0401/squares.gif"><td>&nbsp;<td><img src="0401/squaregraph.gif"></table></center><p>Which graphs can be adjacency graphs?  Can you find 4 congruent polygons that have K<sub>4</sub> (the complete graph on 4 vertices) as an adjacency graph?  How about K<sub>5</sub> minus an edge?  What are the simplest polygons (in terms of number of sides, or aspect ratio, or lack of small angles) that can realize a given adjacency graph?  Can every tree be an adjacency graph?<p>For a real challenge, notice that the graph above is <b>regular</b>, meaning each square touches exactly three other squares.  What are the smallest regular adjacency graphs?  And what are the simplest polygons that create them?<p>

<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Joseph DeVincentis found chevrons with adjacency graphs K<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>5</sub> minus an edge.  They are shown below.<p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0401/k4.gif"><td><td><img src="0401/k5-e.gif"></tr></table></center><p>Here are my polyomino solutions to these problems.<p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0401/k4+.gif"><td><td><img src="0401/k5-e+.gif"></tr></table></center><p>The first figure above was also found by John Hoffman who thinks that it cannot be done with a convex shape.  Sasha Ravsky agrees.  John Hoffman also asks whether every planar graph is realizable as an adjacency graph of a set of congruent polygons?  He guesses no, but I guess yes.  Can anyone find a counterexample?<p>Joseph DeVincentis found that a rectangle that can have an adjacency graph that is 4-regular.  His arrangement is on the left.  My arrangement is on the right.<p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0401/4each.gif"><td><td><img src="0401/4each+.gif"></tr></table></center><p><HR><p>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erichfriedman68@gmail.com">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 12/21/02.<font></BODY></HTML>
