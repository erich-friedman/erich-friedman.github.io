1. The post office wishes to issue a set of stamps   (integer denomination) so that with no more than 3 of them,   you can pay any postage from 1 cent to 70 cents.

For n=14, the member of this family      is tied for optimal, for n=15, 16 or 17, the member      is the unique optimal solution.Note that for n=24, the value is $2.00.  The family member isquite unlikely to still be optimal for n=24, but it would makea nice problem:ObPuzzle:a)  Find 24 denominations such that one can make $.01 through    $2.00 with 2 stamps.  (Easy)b)  Can you get $.01 through $2.xx? (whatever the optimal value    here is).

Maybe one can try to describe the statisticalbehaviour or asymptotics at least. > One more comment on the case of 2 stamps, n denominations: > > For all 1 <= n <= 17, with the exception of n=10, there is > a (not necessarily unique) optimal solution that is "symmetric." > If the optimally attained value is 2v, then a symmetric solution > is defined to have the following form: > > 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., v-a3, v-a2, v-a1, v-1, v. >  > Therefore one could write a program to generate solutions which > are optimal among the symmetric solutions, thereby obtaining good, > and very possibly optimal, solutions well above n=30.Yes, I also noticed that. Unfortunately this doesn't continue for k>2.So ,let's look at the differences of the numbers ( 1st=0 ) instead.You could also take a {n-1}- or {n-2}- solution and insert one (two) newdifference into the middle. Maybe 2nd best solutions should be regardedas well ( take the e.g.100 best symmetric solutions, manipulate them ,choose the 100 best of them etc. )This doesn't _insure_ to get an optimal solution for n , but chances arerather good IMO.This way, you should be able to get upto n = very big.For k>2 it might be useful to change the rules first , such thatless than k stamps or equal denominations are not allowed.I suppose patterns are more likely then.qscgz From: Jim Ferry (jferry@delete_this_field.uiuc.edu) Subject: Re: stamps problem (was Re: 5 Math Puzzles)  Newsgroups: rec.puzzles Date: 1998/10/15 QSCGZ wrote:>  >Do you know how high he was able to get for n=2, n=3 and n=4?>  >My program has gotten to 17, 11 and 9 denominations respectively> > would you mind posting it? Or explaining, how you could do such fast?Okay.  Here's everything I have.  Below are a table of optimalvalues (r stands for a computation still running); the sets ofdenominations that achieve those values; and finally the programI've been using to compute all this.The program is ugly (fortran77! 15 goto statements!).  It worksby keeping an array c of the minumum number of stamps needed tocompute the values 1, 2, . . ., cu(q) for the denominationsi(1), i(2), . . ., i(q) (q = 1 to p-1).  cu(q) is as high as weneed to keep track, and is bounded above by a function au(q).For q = p (the number of denominations) we use a special, fasterprocedure, since this is the inner loop.k = # of stamps, p = # of denominations \ k   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10  p1      1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   102      2    4    7   10   14   18   23   28   34   403      3    8   15   26   35   52   69   89  112  1464      4   12   24   44   71  114  165  234  326  4275      5   16   36   70  126  216  345  512  797 10556      6   20   52  108  211  388  664 1045 1617 25107      7   26   70  162  336  638 1137 2001   r8      8   32   93  228  524   r9      9   40  121  310   r10    10   46  154   r11    11   54  18612    12   64   r13    13   7214    14   8015    15   9216    16  10417    17  11618    18   r-------- 2 stamps, 1 to 17 denominations -------- s(2,1)    2: 1 s(2,2)    4: 1 2  (2,2)    4: 1 3 s(2,3)    8: 1 3 4 s(2,4)   12: 1 3 5 6 s(2,5)   16: 1 3 5 7 8 s(2,6)   20: 1 2 5 8  9 10  (2,6)   20: 1 3 4 8  9 11  (2,6)   20: 1 3 4 9 11 16  (2,6)   20: 1 3 5 6 13 14 s(2,6)   20: 1 3 5 7  9 10 s(2,7)   26: 1 2 5 8 11 12 13 s(2,7)   26: 1 3 4 9 10 12 13  (2,7)   26: 1 3 5 7  8 17 18 s(2,8)   32: 1 2 5 8 11 14 15 16  (2,8)   32: 1 3 5 7  9 10 21 22 s(2,9)   40: 1 3 4 9 11 16 17 19 20  (2,10)  46: 1 2 3 7 11 15 19 21 22 24  (2,10)  46: 1 2 5 7 11 15 19 21 22 24  (2,11)  54: 1 2 3 7 11 15 19 23 25 26 28  (2,11)  54: 1 2 5 7 11 15 19 23 25 26 28 s(2,11)  54: 1 3 4 9 11 16 18 23 24 26 27 s(2,11)  54: 1 3 5 6 13 14 21 22 24 26 27 s(2,12)  64: 1 3 4 9 11 16 21 23 28 29 31 32 s(2,13)  72: 1 3 4 9 11 16 20 25 27 32 33 35 36  (2,14)  80: 1 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 24 25 51 53 55 s(2,14)  80: 1 3 4 5  8 14 20 26 32 35 36 37 39 40  (2,14)  80: 1 3 4 9 10 15 16 21 22 24 25 51 53 55 s(2,15)  92: 1 3 4 5 8 14 20 26 32 38 41 42 43 45 46 s(2,16) 104: 1 3 4 5 8 14 20 26 32 38 44 47 48 49 51 52 s(2,17) 116: 1 3 4 5 8 14 20 26 32 38 44 50 53 54 55 57 58-------- 3 stamps, 1 to 11 denominations --------  (3,1)    3: 1  (3,2)    7: 1 3  (3,3)   15: 1 4 5  (3,4)   24: 1 4 7 8  (3,5)   36: 1 4 6 14 15  (3,6)   52: 1 3 7  9 19 24  (3,6)   52: 1 4 6 14 17 29  (3,7)   70: 1 4 5 15 18 27 34  (3,8)   93: 1 3 6 10 24 26 39 41  (3,9)  121: 1 3 8 9 14 32 36 51 53  (3,10) 154: 1 2 6 8 19 28 40 43 91 103  (3,11) 186: 1 2 3  8 11 26 38 56 69 85 89  (3,11) 186: 1 4 6 13 16 27 44 49 73 81 91-------- 4 stamps, 1 to 9 denominations ---------  (4,1)   4: 1  (4,2)  10: 1 3  (4,2)  10: 1 4  (4,3)  26: 1 5 8  (4,4)  44: 1 3 11 18  (4,5)  70: 1 3 11 15 32  (4,6) 108: 1 4 9 16 38 49  (4,6) 108: 1 5 8 27 29 44  (4,7) 162: 1 4  9 24 35 49 51  (4,7) 162: 1 4 10 15 37 50 71  (4,7) 162: 1 5  8 25 31 52 71  (4,8) 228: 1 3 8 19 33 39 92 102  (4,9) 310: 1 4 10 11 28 33 78 118 143  (4,9) 310: 1 5  7 22 31 36 83 117 133-------- 5 stamps, 1 to 8 denominations ---------  (5,1)   5: 1  (5,2)  14: 1 4  (5,3)  35: 1 6 7  (5,4)  71: 1 4 12 21  (5,4)  71: 1 5 12 28  (5,5) 126: 1 4 9 31 51  (5,6) 211: 1 4 13 24 56 61  (5,6) 211: 1 5  8 33 54 67  (5,7) 336: 1 4 13 24 30 87 106  (5,8) 524: 1 6 8 33 48 77 183 236-------- 6 stamps, 1 to 7 denominations ---------  (6,1)   6: 1  (6,2)  18: 1 4  (6,2)  18: 1 5  (6,3)  52: 1 7 12  (6,4) 114: 1 4 19 33  (6,5) 216: 1 7 12 43 52  (6,6) 388: 1 7 11 48 83 115  (6,7) 638: 1 4 18 31 104 145 170-------- 7 stamps, 1 to 7 denominations ---------  (7,1)    7: 1  (7,2)   23: 1 5  (7,3)   69: 1 8 13  (7,4)  165: 1 5 24 37  (7,5)  345: 1 8 11 64 102  (7,6)  664: 1 7 12 64 113 193  (7,7) 1137: 1 7 18 62 104 244 259  (7,7) 1137: 1 8 13 66 115 254 415-------- 8 stamps, 1 to 7 denominations ---------  (8,1)    8: 1  (8,2)   28: 1 5  (8,2)   28: 1 6  (8,3)   89: 1 9 14  (8,4)  234: 1 6 25 65  (8,5)  512: 1 9 15 78 115  (8,5)  512: 1 9 15 80 118  (8,6) 1045: 1 9 14 65 170 297  (8,7) 2001: 1 6 28 47 127 412 602-------- 9 stamps, 1 to 6 denominations ---------  (9,1)    9: 1  (9,2)   34: 1 6  (9,3)  112: 1 9 20  (9,4)  326: 1 5 34 60  (9,5)  797: 1 9 23 108 181  (9,6) 1617: 1 6 31 48 256 373------- 10 stamps, 1 to 6 denominations --------- (10,1)   10: 1 (10,2)   40: 1 6 (10,2)   40: 1 7 (10,3)  146: 1 10 26 (10,4)  427: 1 6 41 67 (10,5) 1055: 1 8 27 119 194 (10,6) 2510: 1 9 31 96 366 411 From: QSCGZ (qscgz@aol.com) Subject: Re: stamps problem (was Re: 5 Math Puzzles)  Newsgroups: rec.puzzles Date: 1998/10/15 Jim Ferry <jferry@delete_this_field.uiuc.edu> wrote: > a)  Find 24 denominations such that one can make $.01 through >     $2.00 with 2 stamps.
