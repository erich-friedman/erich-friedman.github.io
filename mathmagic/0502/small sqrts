The problem is:        >Find a lower bound on r(n,k), the minimum positive value of        >        >       | sum_{i=1}^k sqrt{a_i} - sum_{i=1}^k sqrt{b_i} |        >        >where a_i and b_i$ are integers no larger than n.Andrew Odlyzko and Michael Ben-Or both informed me that this is aknown difficult problem.  Its decade-old origins are not clear (to me),but at the least Ron Graham has discussed it in public lectures.The consensus seems to be that the only bounds known are somethinglike n^{-2^k}, or perhaps (n*k)^{-2^k}, or perhaps (4*n*k)^{-4^k},but in any case n^{-p} with p exponential in k.  On the other hand,Odlyzko feels that the true bound is more like n^{-k}, or perhapsn^{-2*k}: n^{-p} with p linear in k.  The gap between what can beproved and what seems to be true, is rather wide, but closingit seems difficult.                                --Joseph O'Rourke, Smith College  ------------------------------------------------------------------------From:           eppstein@ics.uci.eduTo:             jmchen@pub.jiangmen.gd.cnSubject:        Re: Welcome to my site on Equal sums of like powersDate:           Mon, 28 Jul 1997 15:10:21 -0700  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for the pointer to your page on equal sums of like powers,http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/chenhome.htmYou know, by the way, of the following application of such sums?It is an important open problem in computational geometry how muchprecision is needed to compute lengths of polygonal paths, in order todetermine which of two paths is longer.  If the path vertices haveinteger coordinates, each length is a sum of square roots of integers,so the problem can be expressed in number-theoretic terms: how small canbe a nonzero number that is the sum of k terms +-sqrt(a_i) where eacha_i is an integer smaller than some bound N.The known lower bounds are something like N^{-2^k}, but the best knownupper bound (i.e. explicit construction) is much larger, something likeN^{-k}.  This upper bound is based on sums like the ones you treat.(I think this may be due to Ron Graham but unfortunately I can't findthe reference offhand -- Marshall Bern showed it to me and Grahammay have showed it to him.)  Here's how it works:Suppose we have two sets of numbers a_i and b_i,such that sum(a_i^j - b_i^j)=0 for all j from 0 to k.(You have a page http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htmon this case.)  For instance, your home page hasa_i={1,19,20,51,57,80,82}, b_i={2,12,31,40,69,71,85}, k=6.Then, consider the number        x = sum(sqrt(N - a_i) - sqrt(N - b_i)).Each of the summands sqrt(N - a_i) can be expressed as a Taylor seriessqrt(N)*(1-y^2-y^2/8-y^3/16-5y^4/128-7y^5/256-...)where y=a_i/N.  The fact that all the sums of powers of ai and biare equal means that the initial terms in these Taylor series canceland x = O(sqrt(n) y^{k+1}) = O(N^{-k-1/2}).Numerically, with the a_i above and N=1000, we have x ~= 2.5 * 10^{-11}.With N=10000 we have x ~= 6 * 10^{-18}, and in general multiplying N by10 is going to lead to a reduction by around 3*10^6 in x.  With more ofthe sums of powers being equal, x would go down even more quickly as afunction of N.  So, solutions to the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem leadto quite small sums of square roots.--David Eppstein          UC Irvine Dept. of Information & Computer Scienceeppstein@ics.uci.edu    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/
