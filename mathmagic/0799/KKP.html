It isproved that the probability that white wins converges to 149/192for n infinite.The necessary formulas are proved at the end of the document to seperatethem from the main idea. The idea is to count the number of possibleking positions for a given pawn position which guarantees black a draw.The criterion for a draw will be simplified that makes itaccessible for calculation. The justification lies in the factthat the probability for the positions where the simplificationis not correct converges to 0 for n infinite.For the calculation the board will be divided into 4 sectors. The numberof the positions added over all pawn positions can be described bya*n^6 + O(n^5) which leads to the needed limit.                      1.The draw criteron                      -------------------Consider a position where the black king is in the square of thewhite pawn and the distance from the black king to the pawn isless than the distance from the white king to the pawn.The "square of the pawn" hereby is the square on the (extended) chessboardwhose diagonal runs from the square of the pawn to the promotian rankon the side of the black king. The "square" can be a rectangle onthe real board, since the diagonal may reach the left or rightborder of the board before it reaches the last row. Sincethe position of the black king is variable in our view itis always a rectangle because we have to consider both diagonals.Graphicly spoken the king stands in the square of the pawn if he canwin the running game against the white pawn alone.Distance means distance in king moves. If the King is on thesquare (c,d) and the pawn is on (a,b) then the distance betweenthem is max(|a-c|,|b-d|).Proposition:The probability that the black king is in the square of thepawn and the distance from the black king to the pawn isless than the distance from the white king to the pawn convergesto the same value as the probability that black reaches a draw.This proposition makes the wanted probability easier for calculation.To show it, first note that illegal positions(king adjacent to king, black in check and white to move,pawn on first or last row)have a probability that converges to 0 for n infinite.Now a closer look to the exceptions:For the rook pawn the chances for black to get a tie are much better.But the probability that a pawn is on this line converges to 0.Another exception are positions like these: white King on d2, pawnon c3, black king on d8. Although the distance from the whiteking to the pawn is 1 and from the black king to the pawn is 5,black has a draw even if it is white to move. But since for everyk>0 the probability that the difference between the white king andblack king pawn distances differ less than k converges to 0,we can ignore all positions where the difference is less than 6.And if the white king has a closer distance by 6 to the pawn thanthe black king he can always gain theopposition in front of the pawn and win.So the proposition is shown. For completion note that the sideto move doesn't matter, becausethe probability of these positions where the side to move mattersconverges to 0 either.                   2.Dividing the board into sectors                   --------------------------------- +-----------+ | AAAAAAAAA |     We divide the chess board into 4 sectors. We have to |B AAAAAAA B|     distinguish the cases because of the changing shape |BB AAAAA BB|     of the square of the pawn depending on the sector |BBB AAA BBB|     it is in. We will count the possible combinations |BBBB A BBBB|     in which black draws the game in each of the sectors. |           | |CCCC D CCCC|     A is the triangle limited by the two diagonals |CCC DDD CCC|     next to the promotion rank, B is the remaining |CC DDDDD CC|     part in the black half. C is the mirror of B |C DDDDDDD C|     reflected by the middle line, D is the mirror | DDDDDDDDD |     of A. See the left 11*11-board for an example. +-----------+ It is not nessecary to think about the diagonals and the middle line itself. The probability that the pawn is on one of these squares converges to 0. We can add them to a arbitrary sector, ignore them or count them twice. Also we don't have to worry about odd or even board size.                            3.Sector A                            ----------       b=     11     12345678901    +-----------+   1!

These positions   4! rqp*pqr   !   can be classified as "stripes" with equal distance a=5! RQPPPQR   !   to the pawn. The 5 "p"-squares have distance 1, the   6!

So the formula  for the positions of the white king (outside the ‚letter'-area) changes  to n^2-(m+a)*(m+b) for m=a to n-a.  Hence the number of possible combinations of white and black  king positions where black makes a draw for a given pawn position  (a,b) in the left part of sector C is:  b-1                               a-1  ---                               ---  \                                 \  /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) +  /   (2m+b) * (n^2 - (m+b)*(2m+1)) +  ---                               ---  m=1                               m=b  n-a  ---  \  /   (2m+b)*(n^2 - (m+b)*(m+a))  ---  m=a  To count all possibilities for all combinations where the white  pawn is in sector C we must again add these values for a&gt;b and a&lt;=n/2  and double the result for the right symmetric part of sector C.  So the total number of positions which black can tie  with the pawn in sector C is:      n/2  a-1  b-1      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) +      ---  ---  ---      a=1  b=1  m=1      n/2  a-1  a-1      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   (2m+b)*(n^2-(m+b)*(2m+1)) +      ---  ---  ---      a=1  b=1  m=b      n/2  a-1  n-a      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   (2m+b)*(n^2-(m+b)*(m+a))      ---  ---  ---      a=1  b=1  m=a That is 1/60*n^6 + 26/1440*n^6 + 94/2304*n^6 + O(n^5) = 29/384*n^6 + O(n^5) by (L1), (L2) and (L3).                            6.Sector D                            ----------     12345678901    +-----------+  11!           !

Here  we have only n squares in the stripe (see the w squares in the example)  and n*(n-a-m) positions of the white king giving black the tie. m runs  from n-b+1 to n-a.  Hence the number of possible combinations of white and black  king positions where black makes a draw for a given pawn position  (a,b) in the left part of sector D is:  a-1                               b-1  ---                               ---  \                                 \  /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) +  /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(m+a)*(2m+1)) +  ---                               ---  m=1                               m=a  n-b                               n-a  ---                               ---  \                                 \  /   (2m+b)*(n^2 - (m+b)*(m+a)) +  /   n*(n*(n-a-m))  ---                               ---  m=b                             m=n-b+1  To count all possibilities for all combinations where the white  pawn is in sector D we must again add these values for b&gt;a and b&lt;=n/2  and double the result for the right symmetric part of sector D.  So the total number of positions which black can tie  with the pawn in sector D is:      n/2  b-1  a-1      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) +      ---  ---  ---      b=1  a=1  m=1      n/2  b-1  b-1      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   ((4m+1)*(n^2-(m+a)*(2m+1)) +      ---  ---  ---      b=1  a=1  m=a      n/2  b-1  n-b      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   (2m+b)*(n^2-(m+b)*(m+a))  +      ---  ---  ---      b=1  a=1  m=b      n/2  b-1  n-a      ---  ---  ---      \    \    \  2 * /    /    /   n*(n*(n-a-m))      ---  ---  ---      b=1  a=1 m=n-b+1 That is 1/60*n^6 + 7/240*n^6 + 53/1152*n^6 + 1/192*n^6 + O(n^5) = 559/5760 * n^6 + O(n^5) by (L1), (L4), (L5) and (L6).                       7.The overall result                       -------------------- Adding the results for sector A, B, C and D we obtain the number of positions with a tie: (1/60 + 559/5760 + 5/144 + 29/384) * n^6 + O(n^5) = 43/192 * n^6 + O(n^5). Since the probabilty of a concrete position of the pieces 1/n^6, the probability for a tie is 43/192 + O(n^5)/n^6 which converges to 43/192. The probability that white wins converges correspondingly to 149/192.                Appendix.Proof of the sum formulas                ----------------------------------The calculation often requires the summation of the first integers,squares or cubes. But in all cases only the coefficient of thehighest degree of the resulting polynomial must be known.Here are all necessary formulas:  n                       n ---                     --- \                       \ /   k = (n^2)/2 + O(n)  /   k^2 = (n^3)/3 + O(n^2) ---                     --- k=1                     k=1 n --- \ /   k^3 = (n^4)/4 + O(n^3) --- k=1  n                           n ---                         --- \                           \ /   k^4 = (n^5)/5 + O(n^4)  /   k^5 = (n^6)/6 + O(n^5) ---                         --- k=1                         k=1Another expression that will be used is pk(a,b,c,..) which denotesa polynomial of a, b, c, .. with max degree k. The purpose is the sameas for the Big-O notation: Just to collect the terms with lower degreewhich doesn't matter for the convergence.They will be used in formulas like these:(b-a+1)^3 = b^3 - 3*a*b^2 + 3*a^2*b - a^3 + p2(a,b)and in generalizations of the above sum formulas: n-a --- \ /   2*k^3 = 2/4*(n-a)^4 + p3(n,a) --- k=1An example how these terms continue: n-b --- \ /   p3(n,a,b) = p4(n,b) --- a=1At last these terms become p5(n) which is of course O(n^5).These equalities are wildly used in the lower calculations.                           LEMMA                           -----(L1) n/2  a-1  b-1 ---  ---  --- \    \    \ /    /    /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) = 1/120*n^6 + O(n^5) ---  ---  --- a=1  b=1  m=1Proof: n/2  a-1  b-1 ---  ---  --- \    \    \ /    /    /   (4m+1)*(n^2-(2m+1)*(2m+1)) = ---  ---  --- a=1  b=1  m=1 n/2  a-1  b-1 ---  ---  --- \    \    \ /    /    /   [4m*n^2 -
