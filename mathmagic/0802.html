Since 1<sup>3</sup> +  2<sup>3</sup> + . . . + n<sup>3</sup> = [ n(n+1)/2 ]<sup>2</sup>, the area of 1 square of side 1, 2 squares of side 2, . . . , and n squares of side n fit exactly inside a square of side n(n+1)/2.  It turns out the smallest value of n for which this packing exists is n=8.  (This was originally found by Bill Cutler, William Marshall, Michael Reid, and Nob Yoshigahara.)  We call this the <b>partridge number</b> of the square.  The packing is shown below:<p><center><img src="0802/8,36.gif"></center><p>What are the partridge numbers of other polyominoes, or other shapes?<p><P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Bill Cutler found the partridge number of a 2&times;1 rectangle is 7:<p><center><img src="0802/2x1.gif"></center><p>He also found the partridge number of a 3&times;1 rectangle is 6.  Ed Pegg reminded me that Andrew Clarke and JosephDeVincentis found that this is easily hand-solved if one takes into parity issues:<p><center><img src="0802/3x1.gif"></center><p>Patrick Hamlyn and his marvelous computer packing program found some amazing packings.  He and Bill Cutler counted the number of partridge packings of squares 1-8 in a 36&times;36 square and came up with 2332.  This implies that the partridge number of all parallelograms is no more than 8.<p>He found that the partridge number of the 4&times;1 rectangle is 7:<p><center><img src="0802/4x1.gif"></center><p>He found the partridge number of the 5&times;1 rectangle is 8.   We can get such packings by stretching partridge packings of squares, but here's one that involves some vertical rectangles as well:<p><center><img src="0802/5x1.gif"></center><p>He also found the partridge numbers of the 3&times;2 rectangle and the 4&times;3 rectangle are 7:<p><center><img src="0802/3x2.gif"></center><p><center><img src="0802/4x3.gif"></center><p>Here is a shape with partridge number 4 by Mike Reid.  This can be stretched along either diagonal axis to give other shapes with partridge number 4.  Another description of these trapezoids is that they have bases of lengths 3 and 6, and at least one side of length 8.<p><center><img src="0802/4type.gif"></center><p>William Marshall found that a packing exists for n=9 for the equilateral triangle, and Patrick Hamlyn confirmed that this was the smallest possible.  This implies that the partridge number of all triangles is no more than 9.<p><center><img src="0802/t1.gif"></center><p>And Patrick Hamlyn found that the partridge number of the triamond is 5:<p><center><img src="0802/t3.gif"></center><p>He found that the partridge number of the 30-60-90 triangle is 4:<p><center><img src="0802/30.gif"></center><p>He found that the partridge number of the 45-45-90 triangle is 8.  This implies that the partridge number of all right triangles is no more than 8.<p><center><img src="0802/45.gif"></center><p>He also found that the partridge number of this trapezoid which is the union of 3 30-60-90 triangles is 6:<p><center><img src="0802/30x3.gif"></center><p>I found another infinite family of trapezoids (bases 1 and 2 and another side of length 2) with partridge number 6:<p><center><img src="0802/trap6.gif"></center><p>

In 2020, George Sicherman sent me this packing of half a domino with partridge number 6:<p>

Philippe Fondanaiche generalized and found tilings of a square by 1 through n squares of size 1 through n, but not necessarily in that order.  He did this for n=7 and n=8 .  He conjectures that the size of the smallest square that can be packed with n different sized squares is 1 + <img src="lfloor.gif" align=abscenter> (n+1)&radic;(n(n+2)/12) <img src="rfloor.gif" align=abscenter>.  He also notes that if there is a partridge packing of 2n different squares, there is also a partridge packing of 2n+1 different squares.  Mike Reid points out the same is true of parallelograms and triangles.<p>Here is a catalog of the the small squares which can be packed with 1 through n squares of size 1 through n.<p><p><CENTER><H2>Distinct Square Packings</H2></CENTER><center><TABLE BORDER bgcolor="FFFFCF" cellpadding=5><TR bgcolor=lightgreen><th>n <th>Sizes of Square</TR><TR align=center><td>1<td><a href="0802/1,1.gif">1</a></TR><TR align=center><td>5<td><a href="0802/5,11.gif">11</a>, <a href="0802/5,12.gif">12</a>, <a href="0802/5,13.gif">13</a></TR><TR align=center><td>6<td><a href="0802/6,14.gif">14</a>, <a href="0802/6,16.gif">16</a>, <a href="0802/6,18.gif">18</a></TR><TR align=center><td>7<td><a href="0802/7,19.gif">19</a>, <a href="0802/7,20.gif">20</a>, <a href="0802/7,21.gif">21</a>, <a href="0802/7,22.gif">22</a>, <a href="0802/7,23.gif">23</a>, <a href="0802/7,24.gif">24</a>, <a href="0802/7,25.gif">25</a>, <a href="0802/7,26.gif">26</a></TR><TR align=center><td>8<td><a href="0802/8,24.gif">24</a>, <a href="0802/8,25.gif">25</a>, <a href="0802/8,26.gif">26</a>, <a href="0802/8,27.gif">27</a>, <a href="0802/8,28.gif">28</a>, <a href="0802/8,29.gif">29</a>, <a href="0802/8,30.gif">30</a>, <a href="0802/8,31.gif">31</a>, <a href="0802/8,32.gif">32</a>, <a href="0802/8,36.gif">36</a></TR></table></center><p>Here are some small triangles which can be packed with 1-n triangles of size 1-n.<p><p><CENTER><H2>Distinct Triangle Packings</H2></CENTER><center><TABLE BORDER bgcolor="FFFFCF" cellpadding=5><TR bgcolor=lightgreen><th>n <th>Sizes of Square</TR><TR align=center><td>1<td><a href="0802/t1,1.gif">1</a></TR><TR align=center><td>5<td><a href="0802/t5,12.gif">12</a>, <a href="0802/t5,13.gif">13</a></TR><TR align=center><td>6<td><a href="0802/t6,14.gif">14</a>, <a href="0802/t6,16.gif">16</a></TR></table></center><p>We can try to pack the partridge squares into rectangles as well.
