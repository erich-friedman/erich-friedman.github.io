<CENTER><H1>Problem of the Month<br>(November 2012)</H1></CENTER>

Most game players know the shortest possible game of chess is 4 moves long: f3 e5 g4 Qh4.<p>

But did you know the shortest game of Othello is 9 moves long?  e6 f4 e3 f6 g5 d6 e7 f5 c5.  This was found originally by Manubu Maruo in 1975.<p>

And contrary to this <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/06/how_to_win_monopoly_in_21_seco.html">NPR page</a>, the shortest game of Monopoly only requires 1 move: Player 1 rolls 3-3, buys Oriental Avenue, sells it to player 2, who sells it back to player 1 for all his money, rolls 6-5, draws "Pay School Tax" of $150, and loses.<p>

<table align=center cellpadding=10><tr><td><img src="1112/chess.jpg"><td><img src="1112/othello.jpg"><td><img src="1112/monopoly.jpg"></table><p>

Note that we count a move by either player as a move.  What are the shortest possible games of other well-known two-player games?<p>

To submit, please send the name of the game, a web link to rules of the game, the number of moves of the shortest game, and a description of how the shortest game occurs.
