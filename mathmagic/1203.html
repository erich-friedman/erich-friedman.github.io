<!doctype html public "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN"><HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Math Magic</TITLE></HEAD><BODY background="formulas.gif"><font size=+1><CENTER><H1>Problem of the Month (December 2003)</H1></CENTER>This month we investigate <b>honest numbers</b>, numbers n that can be described using exactly n letters in standard mathematical English.  For example, the smallest honest numbers are 4 = "four", 8 = "two cubed", and 11 = "two plus nine".  It is known that all n&ge;13 are honest.  Can you prove it?<p>

Define <b>H(n)</b> to be the <b>honesty number</b> of n, the number of different ways that n can be described in exactly n letters.  Can you determine H(n) for some small values of n?<p>

A number is called <b>highly honest</b> if H(n)=n.  Are there any highly honest numbers?<p>

Define <b>L(n)</b> to be the <b>letter number</b> of n, the minimum number of letters needed to describe n.  If L(n) is less than the number of letters in the name of n, we say n is <b>wasteful</b>.  For example, 27 is wasteful since "three cubed" is shorter than "twenty seven".  What other wasteful numbers can you find?

Joseph DeVincentis, Bill Clagett, and Matt King proved that all n&ge;13 are honest.<p>

Joseph DeVincentis gave a nice argument that if there are any highly honest numbers, they must be smaller than 43.  It revolves around the phrase "plus five plus ten" that can be appended any number of times, and rearranged a large number of times for large enough numbers.  His computer program suggested that there are no highly honest numbers at all.<p>

Joseph DeVincentis, Bill Clagett and Clinton Weaver sent many interesting examples of honest numbers.  The first two of these wrote programs to find honest numbers.  My favorite example was from Bill Clagett, who sent:<p>

<center><pre>461 = eighteenth root of eight hundred eighty-four quattuordecillion
three hundred thirty-four tredecillion six hundred eighty duodecillion
eight hundred twenty-six undecillion six hundred fifty-three decillion

quintillion four hundred forty-eight quadrillion seven hundred
ninety-four trillion nine hundred thirteen billion four hundred
thirty-two million nine hundred fifty-nine thousand eighty-one</pre></center><p>

Jeremy Galvagni suggested looking for the "most acceptable" descriptions of n in n letters for dishonest numbers.  My favorites among the suggestions of Joseph DeVincentis and his are below:<p>

<center><pre>0 =              
1 = I            
2 = II           
3 = III          
5 = a five       
6 = one six      
7 = one 'n' six  
8 = one eight
9 = just a nine  
12 = eleven and one</pre></center><p>

Joseph DeVincentis defined a sequence <b>S(n)</b> to be the least positive integer which requires at least n letters to describe.  The sequence starts 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 11, 13, 13, 17, 23, 23, 73, 101, 103, 103, 111, 113, 157, 167.... if the above data is the best possible.  What is S(20)?<p>
