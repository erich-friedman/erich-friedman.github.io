An army marches on its stomach.
Do not cast your pearls before swine.
Do not cross the bridge till you come to it.
Do not cut off your nose to spite your face.
Do not upset the apple-cart.
Feed a cold and starve a fever.
Haste makes waste.
He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword.
If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas.
Many hands make light work.
What goes up must come down.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
You are what you eat

no news is good news
the more the merrier
there's no time like the present
Put your best foot forward
The bigger, the better
