The following puzzles were used as the puzzle of the week at the Macalester College Problem of the Week.<p><hr><font size=+3 color=brown>1.</font> <font color=green>(week of November 5, 2002)</font><p>Find an arrangement of 50 non-overlapping unit squares so that each one touches exactly 4 others.<p><hr><font size=+3 color=brown>2.</font> <font color=green>(week of October 15, 2017)</font><p>
The positive integers x = 692 and y = 1118 have a curious property:<p>

<center>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1728788<br>
x<sup>3</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> = 1728788920</center><p>

The sum of their cubes starts with the digits of the sum of their squares. There are other pairs of positive integers with this property. Find another such pair.<p><hr>

Start with n players each with $1.  Each round, two players X and Y with money left are chosen randomly, and a coin is flipped.  If it is heads, X pays Y $1, and if it is tails, Y pays X $1.  What is the expected number of rounds until one person has all $n?<p><hr>

Find a finite set of interior-disjoint unit squares in the plane such that each square touches exactly three others. <p>

Find a finite set of interior-disjoint 2&times;1 dominoes in the plane such that each one touches exactly four others. <p>

Here "touches" means that the intersection is a line segment that is more than a point.<p><hr>

You are the director of a tournament involving four players, A, B, C, D.  The players are linearly ordered in terms of ability (perhaps C is better than A is better than B is better than D), but you do not know this order.  Your job is to design a tournament that consists of a series of N games in order to maximize the probability that the best player is the champion.  In every game between two players, the better player has a 2/3 chance of winning.  The probability here is over the randomness in the game results and the randomness (as far as the director is concerned) in the ability-ordering of the players (all orderings are equally likely).<p>

For example, if N = 3, the best tournament is A vs. B, C vs. D, and then the two winners against each other.  The best player will win with probability (2/3)(2/3) or 44.4% of the time.  The tournament with A vs. B, winner vs. C, and winner of previous vs. D is not as good.  The best player wins that tournament with probability (2/4)(2/3)<sup>3</sup> + (1/4)(2/3)<sup>2</sup> + (1/4)(2/3) = 42.6%.<p>

For N = 7, the best known tournament is A vs. B, C vs. D, and then a best-of-5 between the winners.  Here the best player wins with probability (2/3) [(2/3)<sup>5</sup> + 5 (2/3)<sup>4</sup> (1/3) + 10 (2/3)<sup>3</sup> (1/3)<sup>2</sup>] = 52.7%.  An alternative is: A and B play a best-of-3, C plays D in a best-of-3, and the winners play each other; here the best player wins with probability [(2/3)<sup>3</sup> + 3 (2/3)<sup>2</sup> (1/3)](2/3) = 49.4%.<p>

Suppose you have N=8 games at your disposal. Design a tournament that has the best player winning more than 53% of the time.<p><hr>

Call a set of equilateral triangles "saturated" if the triangles are interior disjoint, and whose edges are interior disjoint, yet every vertex is on exactly two of the triangles.  Below is a set of 42 saturated congruent triangles. <p>

<center><img src="42.gif"></center><p>
 
a) Find a set of 12 equilateral triangles of two different sizes that is saturated.<p>

b) Find a set of 10 equilateral triangles of three different sizes that is saturated.<p>

c) Find a set of 10 equilateral triangles with integer sides that is saturated.<p><hr>

<font size=+3 color=brown>7.</font> <font color=green>(week of May 1, 2022)</font><p> Alice has 25 coins that look identical but have weights 1, 2, ...., 25 ounces. The coins are marked with labels 1 through 25 and Alice knows that all the labels are correct. Bob knows that the weights are 1 through 25, but knows nothing about the labels. How can she convince Bob that at least one of the labels is correct using just a single weighing on a balance scale?<hr>
