To start, each player throws a die. The player rolling highest becomes the box and plays against all the others who form a team. The second highest becomes the captain of the team. The captain rolls the dice and makes the plays for the team.<p>

When the box wins a game, he collects points from each member of the team. Then the captain goes to the back of the line and the next player on the team becomes the captain. When the team wins, the box pays points to each team member. Then he goes to the back of the line and the captain becomes the new box.<p>

The team players may consult about moves, but the team captain makes the final move decision.  Doubling decisions are made individually.  Some team members might double the box while others don't.  And some team members can take a double by the box while others drop.  Team members who drop out no longer consult with the team.  If the captain drops, the next player in line assumes the captaincy for that game.  A player retains the box for the next game if he defeats the captain.<p>

At the end of the time allotted, whoever has the most points wins.
