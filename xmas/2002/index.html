<title>Christmas 2002</title>

<CENTER><font size=+4 color=brown>Christmas 2002</font></CENTER><P><font size=+1>

<font color=red>This is my first attempt at a mass-produced holiday letter, like the ones I've been receiving for years from certain friends (you know who you are).  I have always been intrigued by the thought of telling ALL my news to ALL the people in my life just by typing it once and having Margie spell check it. <p><font color=green>Our big news is that after 4 years of searching for a house to buy, Margie and I decided to build.  In February, we bought a 3.3 acre fully wooded lot.  We spent the next 5 months designing a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house that would give us plenty of storage space, separate bathrooms, separate walk-in closets, and separate offices.  We DID decide to have the same bedroom.  We broke ground in September, and we're almost half done.  We have walls, a roof, interior walls, and bathtubs.  The shingles and windows and brick are next.  Our builder predicts we'll be in the house by February.  Margie has done most of the work, and has made good choices along the way. <p>

Now my mother lives alone in NYC. <p><font color=green>I added two new states to my list this year: Colorado and New Mexico.  (Actually, I only saw the inside of the Denver airport, but that counts according to my rigid definition.)  This happened in May when I visited my friend Barbara in Albuquerque.  I hadn't visited her for 15 years, so I think it was my turn.  We hiked at 11,000 feet, ate many a breakfast burrito with green chilies (which didn't entirely agree with me), and took a midnight stroll to play on the swing set and count cockroaches.  I was surprised to learn that people really do wear cowboy hats out West!   <p><font color=red>I spent most of the summer learning about computational complexity and proving that various games are NP-complete.  I had two papers published this year, both in the same journal, and one e-paper "republished" (I update it every few years).  Margie spent the summer making final changes to the book that the MAA plans to publish next year. <p><font color=green>I'm still chair of the Math/Computer Science department at Stetson.  I still hate the administrative part of my job, but I get to teach what I want, and still find time to do some research, mostly in the summer.  Stetson is having some financial difficulties this year due to the stock market crash (and a bit of mismanagement which the crash conveniently hides), so morale is low. <p><font color=red>My Rubiks-cube-like puzzle collection continues to grow without bound.  They fill half my office shelves, and I got another one in the mail today.  I'm still making puzzles too, for the web site, and for profit.  They used 5 of my puzzles in the 2002 U. S. Puzzle Championship in July.  (In the puzzle below, put the numbers 1 through 9 in the weights so they all balance.)  About this time, Kadon Enterprises marketed one of my rolling block puzzles.  NPR used one of my puzzles as their weekly puzzle later in the year. <p>

<center><img src="weight.gif"></center><p><font color=green>Also in July Margie and I celebrated our 15th anniversary.  We have talked off and on about having a "non-marriage" ceremony of sorts, but I haven't convinced her yet. <p><font color=red>In October I went back to Indiana for my 15th college reunion.  It was good to see my old professors (though fewer and fewer are left every time I return) and my college buddies again.  But I was disappointed in the number of the Brew Crew who made it back.  We won our homecoming game.  It was weird watching college football since Stetson doesn't have a football team, despite being Division I.  We have a great baseball team (always nationally ranked) though, and we go to all their home games. <p><font color=green>At Michele and Guen's annual Halloween bash, I dressed as a mammogram machine and won best costume!  And then proceeded to drink WAY too many Midori margaritas....  The addition of Emerson to their family means we see Michele and Guen less, but we remain close. <p><font color=red>I didn't vote.  I never do.  But I joined the ACLU.  Go figure. <p><font color=green>My friend Lynn visited for a long weekend in November, and we made fools of ourselves by loudly singing along with the radio in a convertible, building sandcastles, flying kites from a moving car, and playing mini-golf.  I also made two e-friends worth keeping this year, Veronica in AZ (which I plan on visiting in January 2004 for a math conference) and Jane in NJ (which I may never visit again, since it was snowing the last time I was there). <p><font color=red>This coming February I've been invited to give a plenary talk at a conference, my first invited talk!  The teaching remains fun - I've especially enjoyed working with various senior math majors on their research projects this year, and preparing for a computer course I may never get to teach.  This spring I will be teaching two classes with a total of 8 students. <p><font color=green>Favorite food of 2002: Panang Chicken.  Favorite movie of the year: White Oleander.  Biggest change: wearing wire frames.  Favorite music these days: flamenco.  Hobby of the year: making ambigrams.  This year's New Year's resolution: to wear my seat belt. <p><font color=red>Hope you all have happy holidays!
