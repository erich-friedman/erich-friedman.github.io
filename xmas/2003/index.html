<font color=red>Since my mass-produced holiday letter was so well received last year (well, no one told me they hated it), here's my news for 2003. <p><font color=green>In February, I decided to resign as chair of my department effective in August.  It's a long story, but the Reader's Digest version is that I never really liked the job, did it out of duty, and finally decided it wasn't worth it.  Other factors included differences of opinion with the Dean, the lack of time for research and other interests, and the cruddy pay.  <p><font color=red>Also in February, I gave my first plenary talk, which went well despite the cold I was suffering from at the time.  I've been asked to give another key note talk next March at a different conference. <p><font color=green>I had three more of my papers published this year.  One is a collaboration with a professor of Chemistry, and the other two are joint efforts with other mathematicians whom I've never met.  I've been working on some more research with Hari from my department.  <p><font color=red>After meaning to in previous years, I finally succeeded in attending every home game of Stetson's baseball team.  They ended with a record of 36-20, and we came in second in the conference tournament.  On April 12, I caught a fly ball in the stands with my bare hand. (Ouch)  That was also the day of Emerson's first birthday party, which was crowded but fun.  <p><font color=green>The house we built  took longer than we expected to finish.  Many things were done incorrectly the first time, and had to be redone.  The main delay was brick-related, which delayed other things from starting.  But things worked out the way they always do, and we moved in on April 27.  Many thanks to Margie who oversaw the entire process and dealt with most of the hassles.  <p><font color=red>The following week, I celebrated my 38th birthday, my first birthday where my future life expectancy was lower than my age, meaning (sob) that I am finally over the hill.  Birthday presents included clubs for juggling, Beatles CDs, a Stetson baseball T-shirt, and of course the house.  <p><font color=green>In May I had a lot of dental work done, including a crown on a tooth that had a cracked filling.  All year I was sicker than usual, including the usual colds and at least 2 ear infections.  <p><font color=red>In June I visited my friend Lynn in Missouri for 5 days.  We took a hike at a state park that caused us to be covered by ticks (eww!), she  taught me how to make stained glass, we picked up a scary looking hitchhiker, ate guberburgers (hamburgers with peanut butter), toasted marshmallows in her fireplace, and had a cookout where I met her family and friends.  <p><font color=green>The following week Margie and I stayed at a time-share on Singer Island that is owned by one of Margie's college buddies.  We ate well, watched a lot of cable TV, took a moonlight walk on the beach, played mini-golf, soaked in the hot tub, took a hike at Loxahatchee wildlife refuge (which should be named Loxahatchee insect refuge) and shopped.  <p>

We're "square" again.  <p><font color=green>Three of my puzzles were used for the 2003 U. S. Puzzle Championship in July.  (In the puzzle below, put the numbers 1 through 10 in the circles so that each successive pair is farther away than the previous pair.)  I finally found a woodworker who specializes in rendering puzzles in wood, so my puzzle collection is growing even faster now.  <p>

<center><img src="distance.gif"></center><p><font color=red>My friend Lynn and her family visited Florida in August during a trip where her son got married.  When they came to Orange City, we went to the beach, cooked them dinner, and brought them to a park for make-your-own-pancakes.  Then we met them in Tampa to go to the Sunken Gardens and have Greek food.  I'll be visiting her this December as well.  <p><font color=green>I got a new computer in my office in August, a mac G4 with a flat screen monitor.  Much faster than my old one, and better looking.  I've been learning how to rip and burn CD's.  <p><font color=red>Margie spent much time proofreading her second book that was finally published in October.  Her first book was published several years ago, and always earned her royalty checks of (literally) just a few dollars.  In March, she was surprised to receive a MUCH bigger check.  It seems West Point adopted that book!  <p><font color=green>At the yearly Halloween party, I dressed up as the pope, and told folks I was a pedophile.  I won best humorous costume.  <p>

Margie has made many trips to Tampa to check on her mother, who may be coming to live closer to us next year.  <p><font color=green>We spent Thanksgiving with Margie's mother and step-brother.  We have already bought and decorated a 9 foot Christmas tree for the holiday season.  We look forward to the usual holiday parties, and our Christmas day tradition of opening presents and going to the beach. <p><font color=red>New food of 2003: Cherry flavored prunes.  (Further confirmation that I'm getting old) Favorite movie of the year: About Schmidt. Favorite new music: Alison Krauss.  New state that I visited this year: Kansas.  New hobby this year: learning to juggle clubs.  New experiences this year: first limousine ride, first  time testifying in court, saw my first dead body.  This year's New Year's resolution: to finally get a yearly physical.  <p><font color=green>Hope you all have happy holidays!
