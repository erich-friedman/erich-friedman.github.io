<font color=red>My mass-produced holiday letters have become a tradition now (do 3 years make a tradition?). Here's my news for the past year. <p><font color=green>In December 2003, I visited my friend Lynn in Missouri.  I gambled for the first time (lost $40), saw snow for the first time in 6 years, went sledding for the first time in 20 years, met her coworkers, made more stained glass (I did everything but solder), had dinner with her kids, played drunken scrabble, and watched lots of movies. <p><font color=red>December and January were hard on Margie, who had to deal with her 87 year-old mother, who fell and broke her arm. <p><font color=green>In early January, my friend John (half of my friends are named John, this one was my best friend in high school) came to Florida with two of his friends for his bachelor party.  We spent a day at Epcot, my first time there.  The highlights: a French mime, some Chinese acrobats, the Mission to Mars ride, some great Chinese and Middle Eastern food, and one of our ride hosts named Shaun who emphasized the last word of every SENTENCE.  Fun, but not worth the $55 admission. <p><font color=red>In late January, I went to Indiana for John's wedding.  Tons more snow.  Lots of waiting: for pictures, for rides, for people to show up.  But I copied a lot of John's music, let him beat me at a bunch of games, and we taught each other some card tricks.  The wedding rehearsal was the most chaotic I have ever seen.  The morning of the wedding it was -7 degrees outside.  The wedding itself was fun, it was in a Catholic church, but I wore a button on my tux that said "Thank God I'm an Atheist".  After the official reception, there was an unofficial get together where I got plastered and played strip poker with the groom's sister (with her husband and daughter watching). <p>

Neither of us presented anything, but we took a few of our students for the overnight trip.   <p><font color=red>The first week of March was our Spring Break, but because of a Priceline.com mix-up, we stayed in Ft. Meyers instead of Ft. Meyers Beach.  We went on a lot of nature hikes, including one where we hastily abandoned the two most boring nature guides ever.  We saw a yellow rat snake, and three dozen species of birds including a meadowlark, an eagle, white pelicans, and roseate spoonbills.  We climbed the levee to see Lake Okeechobee for the first time.  We ate well, except for an overpriced undercooked Mediterranean place, and the 110 minute wait for an Outback Steakhouse.  I tried frog legs for the first time, and believe it or not, they taste like chicken.  We played lots of mini-golf, did lots of shopping, and visited Margie's college roommate Alyn. <p><font color=green>At the end of March: Margie and I celebrated our 200 month anniversary, and I gave my second ever key-note talk at a conference, which went okay despite the conference being organized by a fellow with the personality of a pet rock.   <p><font color=red>In April, my friend Lynn moved to Cocoa Beach, Florida to take a job with another non-profit.  We see more of each other now that she only lives 75 minutes away. I had a birthday party for the first time in years.  <p><font color=green>The Teacher Creatures continued to attend Stetson baseball games religiously, despite God not being on our team's side this year. <p>

<center><img src="baseball.jpg"></center><p><font color=red>Nothing happened in May.  <p><font color=green>In June, Margie sold her mother's house and consolidated her holdings.  Margie's mother now lives in a nursing home half an hour south of Tampa. <p><font color=red>I finally put my large Rubik Cube puzzle collection on the web, and made some extra shelves to hold them all.  I also contributed 4 puzzles to the U.S. Puzzle Championship, and was interviewed by an on-line puzzle page. <p><font color=green>All summer, we prepared for fall classes, did general house maintenance, and Margie and I had our first annual mini-golf tournament.  I won.  And I got 3 holes-in-one in a row for the first time in my life. <p><font color=red>In August, we went to see Lyle Lovett in concert.  Easily the best concert I've ever seen.  The next day, newly married John came to visit for the weekend.  We saw a movie, went canoeing and saw gators and a manatee, did the touristy thing in St. Augustine, played with puzzles, and went down to Cape Canaveral to see an aborted rocket shot.   <p><font color=green>The next week we took our traditional vacation to Ft. Myers Beach.  Did some bird watching, saw a couple movies, took a romantic moonlight walk on the beach, played lots of mini-golf, ping-pong, and shuffleboard, swam in the gulf, and went shopping.   <p><font color=red>A few days later, hurricane Charley followed us home.  This is the first hurricane to hit our county in 44 years, and I haven't been so scared in a long time.  We lost many trees and branches on our wooded lot, but there was no damage to the house.  We had no power or water for 3 days, which certainly makes one appreciate the conveniences of modern life.  And as if to prove a point, three weeks later we were hit by hurricane Frances, doing more damage to the lot, and cutting off our power and water for another 3 days.  Stetson canceled 2 weeks of classes. And if that weren't enough, 2 weeks later we were hit by hurricane Jeanne.  2 more days without power.  What a long strange trip it's been. <p><font color=green>October and November were largely uneventful.  For the first time in years, we didn't dress up for Halloween, but we hosted Thanksgiving for a small group of friends.  I published a small paper in my favorite journal. <p><font color=red>New food of 2004: Dried cranberries on my cereal.  Favorite movie of the year: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Favorite new music: Sheryl Crow.  This year's biggest surprise: Go Red Sox!  Most anticipated: my sabbatical starting May 2005.  This year's New Year's resolution: to set up a Roth IRA. <p><font color=green>Hope you all have happy holidays!
