<font color=red>As the holidays again approach, let me catch everyone up to date on the news of 2005. <p><font color=green>In January, Margie and I went to Atlanta for a math conference.  I interviewed job candidates, and Margie gave a talk in memory of Jim White, her Mathwright mentor.  We also got to see John, and Gary with his new wife Janet, friends from graduate school, and Linda and Deborah, bird watching friends who live there who made us dinner.<p>

Margie, my friend Lynn, and my coworker Dan jumped with me.  And most of my friends turned out at DeLand Skydive to wait three hours in the baking sun to watch me come down.  <p><font color=green>I didn't have to wait long for the excitement.  While we were walking to the plane, the previous batch of skydivers came down, and one of them almost landed on me.  On the plane, we were packed like sardines, until we reached 13,000 feet.  I don't even remember jumping out.  The freefall was about one minute long, and was very loud and windy. My tandem partner Pedro taught me how to steer both in freefall and with the parachute.  I landed on my hands and knees.  An interesting  experience, but one I won't likely repeat.<p>

Margie is working hard on her third book, and I'm working less hard on some miscellaneous research.  I submitted one paper, and revised another, and began writing a book on recreational packing, tiling, and covering problems.<p><font color=green>A couple weeks later I reported for jury duty.  I've been called 6 times before, but never went.  This time I decided to do my civic duty.  This involved sitting in a room for several hours waiting to be called, and then going up to a courtroom and being interviewed by the judge and the lawyers and not being chosen for the jury.  Big surprise.  A total waste of time.<p><font color=red>Margie and I remain avid Stetson baseball fans, and attended most of the home games this year.  It was a frustrating year (35-28), and we went into the conference championship as the 4th seed.  Then a miracle occurred and we won the tournament, by beating our rivals, the nationally ranked UCF, and several other good teams.  We went to see them play in Gainesville at the NCAA regionals, where we lost to Notre Dame and Florida (who ended up runner-up in the College World Series).<p><font color=green>In June, I had a professional massage (one of Margie's birthday gifts), and I'm sorry to say that it was a disappointment.  Guess Margie has spoiled me with her massages.  <p><font color=red>I also contributed puzzles to the U.S. Puzzle Championship for the 7th straight year, and did some puzzles for hire for Perplex City.  My puzzle collection topped 700 items.  One of my puzzles was used as the puzzle of the week on NPR.  And I contracted with a woodworker (who happens to have lived next door to me in the dorm my sophomore year in college) to render some of my puzzles in hardwood.<p><font color=green>In July we spent a long weekend at the condo of Margie's friend Kirk on the beach in south Florida.  It was terribly hot, so we spent most of our time indoors, shopping , dining out, and watching TV.  We did tour a wildlife area and a nursery, and of course took our usual walks on the beach.  Margie and I also celebrated our 18th anniversary with a day in St. Augustine, where we mostly shopped and ate, but we finally bought some art for our large living room wall.<p><font color=red>In August, the unthinkable happened: we bought a TV.  <p><font color=green>Margie and I had a blast at Michele and Guen's annual Halloween party, and we won best couple costume.<p>

<center><img src="halloween.jpg"></center><p><font color=red>In November, we saw Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, et al, in concert.  All year we spent more time seeing live music (at Caffe Da Vinci and Big Daddy's) than usual.  We also visited a maize maze for the first time.  Later that month we had dinner at a restaurant where Hari, a professor colleague of ours, is attending chef school, and he was our waiter for the evening!  We had Thanksgiving dinner with our game party group.  We all won something and left with lots of leftovers.<p><font color=green>Favorite new food of 2005: Chai.  Favorite movie of the year: Million Dollar Baby.  Favorite new music: Suzanne Vega.  Person who liked my last holiday letter the least: Jenny.  This year's biggest surprise: Stetson winning their conference in baseball.  Most anticipated: the Alaskan cruise.  Most coincidental: Going to Popeye's for lunch twice this year, and the second time finding the receipt for the first time under the seat.  This year's New Year's resolution: to keep walking regularly.<p><font color=red>Hope you all have happy holidays!
