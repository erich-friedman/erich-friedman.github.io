<font color=brown>December 28 2006</font>  Due to inclement weather, we postponed our Christmas walk on the beach a few days, and were glad we did.  We had warm weather, and saw lots of wildlife.  Favorite presents last year: automatically resetting alarm clock for Margie, foam "grow new parents" for Erich.<P>

<font color=brown>January 4-7</font>  Margie went to New Orleans for the big annual math conference.  She and Michael interviewed 20 applicants for a math position.  She also bought Erich a <A HREF="http://hoberman.com/fold/Switchpitch/switchpitch.htm">Switch Pitch</A>, a ball that changes colors when you throw it! The city itself was eerie. The French Quarter was like always, but many other areas had not yet recovered from Katrina over two years ago.<P>

<font color=brown>January 19</font>  Erich got a call from <A HREF="http://www.rd.com/">Reader's Digest</A>, wanting to know whether he would make a puzzle for them.  They originally quoted a price of about a month's salary at Stetson, but later corrected it to a more reasonable week's salary.  This color maze was printed in the April issue.

So Erich, Guen, and Michele met up in Jacksonville for Thai dinner and the show.  Erich had never seen so many lesbians in one place before.  Maybe he needs to get out more.<P>

We saw three purple gallinules!  Margie had seen only one many years ago, and it was a new bird for Erich.  We also saw more yellow-crowned night herons in one tree than Erich had ever seen before. A gator kept a watchful eye on us as we passed.</td></tr></table>

<font color=brown>March 6</font>  On our spring break, we drove to Cape Canaveral for the day to play and rate another mini-golf course.  We had lunch with Lynn, an old friend of Erich that we don't see much any more.  After getting back home, we played koi-koi with Barbara.<p>

<table bgcolor=CCFFCC><tr><td><font size=+1><font color=brown>March 9</font>  We took a canoe trip on the St. Johns river starting in <a href="http://www.planetdeland.com/bluesprings/">Blue Spring State Park</a>.

You can see some more pictures of our trip <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/canoe">here</a>.  Deland, which was originally named Persimmon Hollow, celebrated its 125<sup>th</sup> anniversary.  Erich, who is collecting state quarters, found Montana.</td></tr></table><p>

<font color=brown>March 14</font>  The math majors at Stetson celebrated &pi; day.  One of Erich's teeth started hurting because of a sinus infection, and required local anesthetic several times a day.  Erich learned some geocachers hid a cache and used his special numbers page for <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=9d39849a-f569-465e-a668-f30072161d65">hints</a>.  The cache of small prizes was hidden in the hollow of a tree in a parking lot in Texas.  And Phillip introduced us to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Boros">Steve Boros</a>, who came to one of the Stetson baseball games.<P>

<font color=brown>March 24</font>  A foul ball at the baseball game bounced into the open window of the press box!  A few days later, we saw our first triple play, and we lost the game because of it.  Erich did his taxes, the latest ever.  Took him 10 minutes and he got a hefty refund.<P>

<font color=brown>March 29</font>  Erich called his dentist about a broken wisdom tooth, and walked out of the dentist's office with a new tooth 45 minutes later!  And in the ultimate irony, Erich talked with <a href="http://www.esquire.com">esquire.com</a>, the web site connected with Esquire magazine, about how to pick up women using numbers.  The following day, there was a fire drill during Erich's office hours, and he brought a white board outside to continue tutoring a student.<P>

<font color=brown>April 12-15</font> Margie flew to Austin to attend a conference on inquiry-based learning. As usual, she returned full of enthusiasm to redo all of her courses.  Both <a href="http://www.jimmylafave.com/">Jimmy Lafave</a> and <a href="http://www.dirtynelson.com/linen/feature/62ball.html">Marcia Ball</a> were playing in town, but Margie chose to socialize with a small group of fellow conference-goers instead. They walked down South Congress Ave. to window shop, listen to some Texas swing (<a href="http://www.reddvolkaert.com/">Redd Volkaert</a> at the <a href="http://www.continentalclub.com/Austin.html">Continental Club</a>) and greet <a href="http://austin.about.com/cs/bats/p/bats.htm">the bats</a>. Only a few of the latter stirred themselves, as it was rather cold.  The return flight took off late, circled the temporarily closed Orlando airport, missed landing on the first approach, and missed the proper spot to hook up to the jet way at the gate. Well, every pilot has to have a first flight....  <p>

We saw 29 species of birds on Sanibel Island, plus the usual gators and tree crabs.  Erich got sunburned.  Margie spent a lot of money shopping.  We got to play mini-golf free at a course that Erich had <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/minigolf">reviewed</a>.  At our favorite Thai restaurant, a psychotherapist (emphasis on the psycho) sat at the next table and proceeded to talk about decapitated heads.  We visited the southern most winery in the country.  We visited a small zoo, and enjoyed the otter frolicking, gator petting, and crane dancing.  We also got plastered at the tiki bar.

<font color=brown>May 2</font> To celebrate the full moon, and Erich's birthday, and the end of the school year, we tried a new restaurant in New Smyrna Beach.
