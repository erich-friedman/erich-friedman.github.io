"Hurting yourself with penalties on either side, as we've seen early in this game, will really hurt each team."<p>

"Sometimes you have to let players make plays."<p>

"TCU (who was winning 42-3 at the time) has almost been the better, faster team here today."<p>

"That could be a play that ends up determining the outcome of this game."<p>

"There were three players in the general vicinity and neither came up with it."<p>

"If this game continues, they have to think about blitzing."<p>

"That would have been an excellent play if he could have gotten the ball."<p>

"Obviously the Pittsburgh Steelers want to score some points."<p>

"That's a touchdown in the end zone."<p>

"It's first and 10.  Oh, it looks like a long 10, so it's first and goal."<p>

"If he lets go if him, that's not holding."<p>

"You don't have to rush, but you do have to have a sense of urgency."<p>

"The pass is complete, now incomplete, and intercepted!"<p>

"First quarter time of possession: 7:27 for Wisconsin, 7:33 for Iowa.  You can't get any closer."<p>

"It's a good thing he made that tackle, or the quarterback might have kept running."<p>

"If they don't drop passes, they have a better chance of moving the ball down the field."<p>

"He's convinced they're going to get there, wherever there is."<p>

"The ball is still in possession, and as his arm is moving forward, the ball is still in possession, meaning he has possession of the ball."<p>

"That (3-point) field goal made it a 9-point game.  If he had missed it, it would be an 8-point game."<p>

"It was defended perfectly, but the runner slipped through anyway."
