<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; After paying no tax in 2019, Erich got a letter from the IRS saying he might be eligible for a refund.  We finished watching all 6 seasons of "Hogan's Heroes".  Margie found 3 golf balls in our yard.  Erich shaved half his beard.  Our refrigerator needed a new thermostat.  Erich watched season 1 of "Good Girls".<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; We watched the South Florida Folk Festival online.  Erich watched seasons 2 and 3 of "Good Girls".  We had a whip-poor-will visit our back yard.  Margie got her second vaccine shot.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; When John and Dawn visited for the day, we had BBQ at Lake Beresford Park, and did some trivia.  Erich finally watched "Queen's Gambit".  We had a nice dinner at the Branton's place.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; Margie celebrated a birthday with Missy and Barbara, the taste of new food, the sound of birds, and the fragrance of jasmine.  Margie found a tree in our yard attacked by woodpeckers.  Erich got his second vaccine shot.  Margie saw a barred owl at our water dish.  We met Margie's cousin Curt, whom she had not seen in 40 years.  Margie celebrated Earth Day by picking up almost 2 miles of trash.  Erich was laid low by his second vaccine shot.  But he got thousands of calories in birthday packages, so thanks to you know who!  We celebrated Erich's actual birthday in an actual Indian restaurant.<p>
