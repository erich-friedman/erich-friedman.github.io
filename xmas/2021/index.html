<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; After paying no tax in 2019, Erich got a letter from the IRS saying he might be eligible for a refund.  We finished watching all 6 seasons of "Hogan's Heroes".  Margie found 3 golf balls in our yard.  Erich shaved half his beard.  Our refrigerator needed a new thermostat.  Erich watched season 1 of "Good Girls".<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; We watched the South Florida Folk Festival online.  Erich watched seasons 2 and 3 of "Good Girls".  We had a whip-poor-will visit our back yard.  Margie got her second vaccine shot.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; When John and Dawn visited for the day, we had BBQ at Lake Beresford Park, and did some trivia.  Erich finally watched "Queen's Gambit".  We had a nice dinner at the Branton's place.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; Margie celebrated a birthday with Missy and Barbara, the taste of new food, the sound of birds, and the fragrance of jasmine.  Margie found a tree in our yard attacked by woodpeckers.  Erich got his second vaccine shot.  Margie saw a barred owl at our water dish.  We spent a day with Margie's cousin Curt, whom she had not seen in 40 years.  Erich was laid low by his second vaccine shot.  Margie celebrated Earth Day by picking up almost 2 miles of trash.  The IRS didn't agree that Erich should pay $0 in tax for 2019... so they sent him a check for $72.  Erich got thousands of calories in birthday packages, so thanks to you know who!  Erich published a note in the American Mathematical Monthly.  We celebrated Erich's actual birthday in an actual Indian restaurant.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>May</font> &nbsp; A possum came to our water dish.  Erich bought Margie a sign related to two of her favorite things.  Our clothes washer, which was more than 40 years old, finally needed to be replaced.  In addition to Erich's weekly backgammon game with Bill, he played a few times with Rob as well.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>June</font> &nbsp; We got to see Dan and Ranjini's condo on the beach when they hosted us for dinner.  We celebrated Missy's birthday with Mexican takeout and games.  A family of raccoons came to our water dish.  We had the trees hanging over our roof trimmed back.  We attended a games party at the Dunn's.  Erich followed his dental hygienist to a new dentist.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>July</font> &nbsp; Erich's college buddy John and his girlfriend Dawn visited us again.  And then the next wave of covid hit.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>August</font> &nbsp; Erich watched about 50 hours of Olympics, mostly net sports but also water polo, climbing, and archery.  Pancho preferred the sport of laying around dogie day care.  Andrea Gilbert turned some of my static puzzles into interactive puzzles, for example <a href="https://clickmazes.itch.io/birdwatching-puzzles">here</a>.  Then some guy named Pedro started doing the same, and you can see his work <a href="https://pedropsi.github.io/tag.html?search=erich">here</a>.<p>
