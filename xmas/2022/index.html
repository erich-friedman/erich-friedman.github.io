<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; After opening presents on Christmas, we took Pancho to the dog beach.  On the way home from dinner one night, Erich had to dodge a car going the wrong way down the divided highway.  Some of Erich's puzzles were used in a newsletter for New Jersey teachers.  Margie and Pancho saw a coyote in our front yard.  And then they saw a different one the next day.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; Erich watched the third season of "After Life" and the first two seasons of "Lupin".<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; Pancho turned 10.  We watched "Groundhog Day" again.  We had Missy, Barbara, and John over for Mah Jongg to celebrate Chinese New Year.  Margie injured herself walking Pancho.  Then one of her dog walkers caught covid, giving us a scare.  Erich watched about 48 hours of Olympic coverage, mostly curling.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; We visited Erin and Tom at their condo.  We celebrated at Miguel's birthday party.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; We celebrated Margie's birthday with some fine Indian food.  And then celebrated again with Missy and Barbara and John with Thai food and games.  We got a new UV light system to purify our well water.  We played bocce and had drinks and dinner with Bill and Judi.  We celebrated Easter with lots of our friends at Joan's.<p>
