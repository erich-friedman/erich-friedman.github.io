<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; After opening presents on Christmas, we took Pancho to the dog beach.  On the way home from dinner one night, Erich had to dodge a car going the wrong way down the divided highway.  Some of Erich's puzzles were used in a newsletter for New Jersey teachers.  Margie and Pancho saw a coyote in our front yard.  And then they saw a different one the next day.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; Erich watched the third season of "After Life" and the first two seasons of "Lupin".<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; Pancho turned 10.  We watched "Groundhog Day" again.  We had Missy, Barbara, and John over for Mah Jongg to celebrate Chinese New Year.  Margie injured herself walking Pancho.  Then one of her dog walkers caught covid, giving us a scare.  Erich watched about 48 hours of Olympic coverage, mostly curling.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; We visited Erin and Tom at their condo.  We celebrated at Miguel's birthday party.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; We celebrated Margie's birthday with some fine Indian food.  And then celebrated again with Missy and Barbara and John with Thai food and games.  We got a new UV light system to purify our well water.  We played bocce and had drinks and dinner with Bill and Judi.  We celebrated Easter with lots of our friends at Joan's.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Sylvia</font> &nbsp; Erich's friend Sylvia from Germany visited us for 5 days.  We celebrated all of our recent birthdays by eating cake for breakfast and opening presents.  We had Ethiopian, Caribbean, Cajun, and Thai food, made pancakes at The Sugar Mill, and cooked our spinach/almond lasagna.  We went to Blue Spring twice, Green Spring, Lake Woodruff, Lake Beresford, and the ocean.  We attended a softball game, did a tour of Stetson, visited the key lime shop, played another round of bocce with Bill and Judi, and listened to Jazz in the Alley.  We also held a home trivia party, spent a day in St. Augustine, and another day at the Kennedy Space Center.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>May</font> &nbsp; A few days later, we went to the Gamble Rogers Folk Festival, which had been canceled the previous two years due to Covid.  Erich got his fourth Covid shot.<p>
