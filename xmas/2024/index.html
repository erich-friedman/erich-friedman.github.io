<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; We took Pancho to the dog beach a few days before Christmas to avoid the rain.  Erich watched season 2 of "Star Trek - Strange New Worlds".  We enjoyed Michael and Deborah's Solstice pot luck, and our table won their Winter Trivia.  Erich watched season 1 of "3%".  <p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; We enjoyed Bill and Judi New Year's pot luck, and Miguel and Erich won this year's bocce tournament.  Erich watched season 2 of "3%" and seasons 1 and 2 of "Foundation".  We finished watching the entire series of "The Big Bang Theory" for the second time.  We went to games parties at Miguel and Regina's, and Missy's.  Margie took some great nature photos.  We went to a baseball game, where Erich got his first ever January sunburn.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; The Thai restaurant got Margie's order wrong and made chicken pad thai instead of tofu.  So without our knowledge they made her the correct order to take home for free, and then tried to charge us for it!  Pancho turned 12.  Erich watched season 3 of "3%".<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; At a Stetson baseball game, we saw a batter called out for using an illegal bat!  Erich saw a deer on our lane for the first time.  Erich watched season 4 of "3%".  Margie spent a day in the emergency room, and a few days later, Pancho spent 3 nights at the emergency animal hospital.  We enjoyed a nice dinner at Michael and Deborah's.  We saw a wild turkey on our morning walk.  Erich was diagnosed with an eye infection, then conjunctivitis, then an eye virus, then allergies, then calcium concretions, then eye mites, though the problem has not yet been solved.  Erich watched season 2 of "Halo".  We celebrated Margie's birthday a few days early with Missy, Barbara, and John.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; At the annual mini-golf tournament, we got 2nd and 5th out of 9, but Erich won the "most improved" trophy.  We saw the eclipse.  Erich was supposed to get a visit from his German friend Sylvia, go to Gamblefest with Margie, and spend a week in Oregon, but none of that happened because of a diverticulitis episode.  Erich started playing in the bi-weekly Sanford Backgammon Group.  Erich watched season 4 of "Star Trek - Lower Decks".  Pancho likes to lunge at raccoons, even ones painted on bricks.  Margie and Missy spent a morning at Lake Woodruff.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>May</font> &nbsp; Margie found a pet bird.  The bagger at Publix sent Erich home with 4 bags when 1 would have sufficed.  Shannon took Erich, the Brantons, and the Dunns on a boat tour of Winter Park.  We got a new roof.  And a new air conditioning unit.  Margie offers this wisdom: "The body part that gets the most lotion? Palms of the hands."<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Sylvia</font> &nbsp; Erich's friend Sylvia visited from Germany.  We kayaked Blue Spring, walked trails at Gemini Springs, Green Spring, and Black Bear Wilderness Preserve, and spent a day at the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge (where we ran into Catalina and Billy!).  We hosted a trivia party, played mini-golf (it was Sylvia's first time, and she was pretty good), did Daytona's Museum of Arts and Science, went to a Museum of Illusions, and played bocce at Bill and Judi's (it was Sylvia's second time, and she almost won!).<p>

<font color=green size=+2>July</font> &nbsp; Erich was supposed to finally go to Oregon in early July, but his first flight to Dallas was leaving 3 hours late, so there was no way to get there for DAYS, so he pulled the plug.  But despite talking to 4 people at the airport about it, filling out forms, calling repeatedly when he got home, his luggage went to Eugene without him.  He added American to the list of airlines he will not use anymore.  Erich owned a cell phone for about an hour - it didn't work, so he returned it.  On the same day, our water heater leaked and flooded our garage, and our well pump stopped working.  Erich came home from the grocery with two peaches that he neither picked out nor paid for.  Erich reached Master level 1 at backgammon.  Erich got sicker than usual, causing another round of postponements.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Monet</font> &nbsp; Erich went to visit his friend Monet and his luggage in Eugene.  We got high, did psychedelic shrooms, and drank a lot.  We had a joint caricature drawn at the Saturday market, went to a raptor center, took a private river cruise, took a private glass blowing course, drove to the coast for a day, and he climbed a mountain with his high school girlfriend Liz, whom he hadn't seen in 39 years.  We ate at a different bakery every morning, ate at a lot of food trucks in the evenings, and he got to meet her kids and her best friends.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>August</font> &nbsp; We played mah jongg at Barbara's place.  Our water pump stopped working again, and neighbor Mark came to our rescue.  Erich watched the 2 seasons of "The Lazarus Project" and the last season of "The Umbrella Academy".  Margie saw a bear on our road while walking Pancho.  Erich reached Master level 2 at backgammon.  Jeff, one of Erich's college buddies, was struck and killed while riding his bike. <p>

Margie's grade school friend Patty came to visit for a few days.  We walked around Gemini Springs, had lunch and watched sky divers come down, and hosted a trivia night.  Hurricane Helene caused us to lose power for 12 hours.  Margie offers this wisdom: "You can remember and you can forget, but no one can remember to forget."<p>

<font color=red size=+2>October</font> &nbsp; Hurricane Milton caused us to lose power for 2 days.  Margie fell and broke her shoulder.  Erich's last uncle died.  Erich made <a href="https://mailchi.mp/quantamagazine.org/why-colliding-particles-reveal-reality-2493341?e=ef74ccedec">Quanta Magazine</a>.  We had to put Pancho to sleep after a long, happy life.  We had our carpets professionally cleaned for the first time in 23 years.  Erich's mother died at the age of 82.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>November</font> &nbsp; Erich got a cold.  Our pile of hurricane debris was mysteriously picked up, the only one on our lane.  Erich saw someone pull into a left turn lane on a multi-lane road, and then cut across traffic to turn right instead.  We saw a family of black-bellied whistling ducks at Mill Lake.  The Brantons took us out for dinner to repay us for taking care of their mail this summer.  We enjoyed Joan's Thanksgiving pot luck dinner.  We watched "A Man on the Inside".<p>

<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; Erich watched season 1 of "Star Trek - Prodigy".  One of our neighbors likes Christmas decorations.  Erich had his second colonoscopy and second esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The latter found a dozen benign stomach polyps that Erich will have out sometime soon.  A friend's digital clock read 4:64.  Erich enjoyed the Branton's solstice celebration.<br>
