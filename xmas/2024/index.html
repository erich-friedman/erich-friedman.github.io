<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; We took Pancho to the dog beach a few days before Christmas to avoid the rain.  Erich watched season 2 of "Star Trek - Strange New Worlds".  We enjoyed Michael and Deborah's Solstice pot luck, and our table won their Winter Trivia.  Erich watched season 1 of "3%".  <p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; We enjoyed Bill and Judi New Year's pot luck, and Miguel and Erich won this year's bocce tournament.  Erich watched season 2 of "3%" and seasons 1 and 2 of "Foundation".  We finished watching the entire series of "The Big Bang Theory" for the second time.  We went to games parties at Miguel and Regina's, and Missy's.  Margie took some great nature photos.  We went to a baseball game, where Erich got his first ever January sunburn.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; The Thai restaurant got Margie's order wrong and made chicken pad thai instead of tofu.  So without our knowledge they made her the correct order to take home for free, and then tried to charge us for it!  Pancho turned 12.  Erich watched season 3 of "3%".<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; At a Stetson baseball game, we saw a batter called out for using an illegal bat!  Erich saw a deer on our lane for the first time.  Erich watched season 4 of "3%".  Margie spent a day in the emergency room, and a few days later, Pancho spent 3 nights at the emergency animal hospital.  We enjoyed a nice dinner at Michael and Deborah's.  We saw a wild turkey on our morning walk.  Erich was diagnosed with conjunctivitis, and then an eye virus, and then allergies, but we still don't know what it was.  Erich watched season 2 of "Halo".  We celebrated Margie's birthday a few days early with Missy, Barbara, and John.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; At the annual mini-golf tournament, we got 2nd and 5th out of 9, but Erich won the "most improved" trophy.  We saw the eclipse.  Erich was supposed to get a visit from his German friend Sylvia, go to Gamblefest with Margie, and spend a week in Oregon, but none of that happened because of a diverticulitis episode.  Erich started playing in the twice-a-month Sanford Backgammon Group.  Erich watched season 4 of "Star Trek - Lower Decks".  Pancho likes to lunge at raccoons, even ones painted on bricks.  Margie and Missy spent a morning at Lake Woodruff.<p>
