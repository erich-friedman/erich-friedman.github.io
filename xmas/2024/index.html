<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; We took Pancho to the dog beach a few days before Christmas to avoid the rain.  Erich watched season 2 of "Star Trek - Strange New Worlds".  We enjoyed Michael and Deborah's Solstice pot luck, and our table won their Winter Trivia.  Erich watched season 1 of "3%".  <p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; We enjoyed Bill and Judi New Year's pot luck, and Miguel and Erich won this year's bocce tournament.  Erich watched season 2 of "3%" and seasons 1 and 2 of "Foundation".  We finished watching the entire series of "The Big Bang Theory" for the second time.  We went to games parties at Miguel and Regina's, and Missy's.  Margie took some great nature photos.  We went to a baseball game, where Erich got his first ever January sunburn.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; The Thai restaurant got Margie's order wrong and made chicken pad thai instead of tofu.  So without our knowledge they made her the correct order to take home for free, and then tried to charge us for it!  Pancho turned 12.  Erich watched season 3 of "3%".<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; At a Stetson baseball game, we saw a batter called out for using an illegal bat!  Erich saw a deer on our lane for the first time.  Erich watched season 4 of "3%".  Margie spent a day in the emergency room, and a few days later, Pancho spent 3 nights at the emergency animal hospital.  We enjoyed a nice dinner at Michael and Deborah's.  We saw a wild turkey on our morning walk.<p>
