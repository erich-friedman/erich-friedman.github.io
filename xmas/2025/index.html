<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; We went to the beach on Christmas, as is our tradition.  Erich won a free membership to chess.com for a month.  Erich enjoyed listening to Bob's band.  We celebrated New Year's Eve alone and fairly quietly.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; Erich got 4th in Bill & Judi's annual bocce tournament.  Erich found out that <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/0800.html">Friedman numbers</a> are being used by Jewish numerologists to pick out verses from the Torah to find the ultimate truth.  We went to a happy hour at Adele and Jim's and got to throw axes.  We celebrated the Chinese New Year at Missy's place.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Monet</font> &nbsp; Erich's friend Monet visited from Oregon.  We went to the space center, a bunch of art museums and the New Smyrna art festival, St. Augustine for a mixture of historical and musical adventures, and all the springs in the area for make-your-own pancakes, kayaking, and manatees.  We also watched skydivers fall from the sky during lunch at the Perfect Spot, did a campus tour, and hosted a home trivia. <p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Barb and Peter</font> &nbsp; Erich's oldest friend Barb and her fianc√© Peter visited from Ireland.  We couldn't do much due to Barb's ankle injury, but we visited some springs, saw skydivers, visited the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey, and had some fine meals.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; On a walk, Margie found an old woman wandering in our neighborhood, and brought her back home.  Erich watched season 5 of "Star Trek - Lower Decks".<p>
