<font color=red size=+2>December</font> &nbsp; We went to the beach on Christmas, as is our tradition.  Erich won a free membership to chess.com for a month.  Erich enjoyed listening to Bob's band.  We celebrated New Year's Eve alone and fairly quietly.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>January</font> &nbsp; Erich got 4th in Bill & Judi's annual bocce tournament.  Erich found out that <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/0800.html">Friedman numbers</a> are being used by Jewish numerologists to pick out verses from the Torah to find the ultimate truth.  We went to a happy hour at Adele and Jim's and got to throw axes.  We celebrated the Chinese New Year at Missy's place.  We got to see how bionic Margie has become.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Monet</font> &nbsp; Erich's friend Monet visited from Oregon.  We went to the space center, a bunch of art museums and the New Smyrna art festival, St. Augustine for a mixture of historical and musical adventures, and all the springs in the area for make-your-own pancakes, kayaking, and manatees.  We also watched skydivers fall from the sky during lunch at the Perfect Spot, did a campus tour, and hosted a home trivia. <p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Barb and Peter</font> &nbsp; Erich's oldest friend Barb and her fianc√© Peter visited from Ireland.  We couldn't do much due to Barb's ankle injury, but we visited some springs, saw skydivers, visited the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey, and had some fine meals.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>February</font> &nbsp; On a walk, Margie found an old woman wandering in our neighborhood, and brought her back home.  Erich watched season 5 of "Star Trek - Lower Decks".  We cleaned our garage, something we don't remember doing before.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>March</font> &nbsp; Our 44-year-old clothes dryer needed a new belt, but is still working.  In contrast, our 10-year-old vacuum cleaner died, and we bought a new one.  Erich got another stomach polyp removed.  We had some ceiling stains painted.  We attended Miguel's birthday party.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Sylvia</font> &nbsp; Erich's German friend Sylvia visited again.  We visited a lot of parks, gardens, springs, beaches, and wildlife refuges, as well as the bird of prey center.  The best sightings: green herons, roseate spoonbills, and an armadillo.  We visited the <a href="https://morsemuseum.org/">Morse Museum</a>, saw a rocket launch, went to a baseball game, held a trivia party, and Shannon was nice enough to give us a boat tour of Winter Park.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>April</font> &nbsp; Margie turned 74 with no fanfare.  Erich had a tooth pulled, but he got to keep the old gold crown as a souvenir.  Erich played backgammon with a new friend (who will remain nameless, but it wasn't Bill) and won 17-0.  Margie saw an actual Easter bunny.  Erich renewed his driver's license, and passed his vision test for the first time, so he can drive (legally) without glasses.  The Brantons invited us out to see Dalton James, an amazing guitarist.  Erich had cake for dinner on his birthday.<p>

<font color=green size=+2>May</font> &nbsp; We went to St. Augustine for the day to listen to Scott Halls, Baby Gray, the Dewey Via Band, and Shyla Macaluso.  Margie fainted twice and spent a night in the hospital, but developed severe back pain as a result.  Stetson baseball won their conference by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2025/05/25/asun-baseball-championship-canceled-automatic-qualifier-stetson-florida-gulf-coast/83859089007/">losing their final game</a>.<p>

<font color=blue size=+2>Monet</font> &nbsp; Erich went to Eugene, Oregon to visit his friend Monet.  We visited lots of falls, walked around several parks, drove down the coast, saw some live music (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxZ0UTuIYM">Sarah Adams</a>), hosted a trivia party, visited a <a href="https://www.lavellevineyards.com/">winery</a> and <a href="https://www.cascadestreetdistillery.com/">distillery</a>, went dancing under the influence of cocaine, and ate like royalty.  We spent a day in Portland where we visited <a href="https://omsi.edu/">OMSI</a>, shopped at <a href="https://www.powells.com/">Powell's</a>, saw the Portlandia statue, and had <a href="https://www.blackstargrill.com/">Ghanaian food</a>.  I also spent a day with my high school girlfriend Liz, met her husband Randy, and saw her parents for the first time in 42 years.<p>

<font color=red size=+2>June</font> &nbsp; During my weekly backgammon session with Bill, I rolled 5-5, then he did, then I did, then he did.  The chances of that happening are 0.00006%.  We went to see Brian Smalley in Lake Mary.<p>
